### What I Worked On

* Created Home Page to include a placeholder image and two buttons to take user to add task page and all tasks page
* For add task page, I created two input fields for user to add task title and description and also a button for submission. For now, the submit button only show a pop up message with the word "Submitted!"
* For all tasks page, there is an image and a label.
